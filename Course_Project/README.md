# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Here are the instructions on how the R script run_analysis.R works. 

1. Unzip the data from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
and make sure the folder “UCI HAR Dataset” is in the working directory as well as run_analysis.R script.

2. Open run_analysis.R in RStudio.

3. Run the command source(‘run_analysis.R”).

4. The output file “tidy_data_meanActivityAndSubject.txt” will be saved in the working directory.
